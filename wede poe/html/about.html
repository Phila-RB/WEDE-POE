               I hold both a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a Master of Arts in Psychology from Eduvos,
               where I developed a strong foundation in evidence-based therapeutic approaches, including Cognitive 
               Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based techniques, and trauma-informed care. My training and experience
               have shaped a holistic and client-centered approach that prioritizes emotional safety, self-awareness, and 
               practical tools for daily life. I believe that therapy is not just about managing symptoms — it's about empowering 
               you to live with greater clarity, connection, and purpose. <br><br>

               At the heart of my work is a deep belief that healing begins with feeling truly seen and heard. As a registered psychologist,
                I offer a compassionate and supportive space where clients can safely explore their thoughts, emotions, and life experiences.
                 Whether you're navigating anxiety, trauma, relationship difficulties, or simply feeling overwhelmed, my goal is to help you
               understand yourself more deeply and move toward meaningful, lasting change.
